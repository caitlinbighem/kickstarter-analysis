An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project: Help a an up and coming playwright start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her new play Fever using Excel to organize, sort and analyze crowdfunding data to determine what individual factors that contribute to a campaigns success. These insights will be used to help Louise plan her own campaign to set it up for success. This analysis will provide a great understanding of campaigns from beginning to end and a guideline for Louise follow as she launches her own campaign.

### Purpose - Organize data in a way that is converted to visuals and easy to read. Provide insights that will contribute to a successful fundraising campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

#### The objective within this sheet was to determine what months the most successful campaigns took place. Obtaining this information involved organizing the data in the form of building a pivot table and displaying all outcomes of theater campaigns. While it was unclear at first whether to display the data by year, month or individual dates, after a number of filtering options and techniques, adjusting the visual display of the data to show the number of outcomes by month was the most visually satisfying. As a result, the line graph displayed clearly states most successful campaigns were launched within the month of May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

#### In order to determine the success and failure rates for a plays individual fundraising campaigns, we first needed to confirm the count based on each campaigns specific goals. While this involved sorting the data with distinct goal ranges and displaying the data driven results, a number of interesting insights can be found within the analysis. For example, per review of Outcomes Based on Gals sheet, it has been determined that Plays with less than $1000 goals were successful 76% of the time. While any fundraising campaign with goals exceeding $15,000 had a failure rate of 90%.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

#### While the amount of data may seem overwhelming, the challenge was to determine the most helpful variables of the full dataset. Then to break it down and display the different findings and trends into easily understood information at a quick glance.
